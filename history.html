                        <h5>Policy Product - Application Developer - 2017 - 2019</h5>

                        <p>Instec is an insurance software company of around 150 employees. The company offers several highly customizable products that are used by insurance providers to automate and enhance their workflows. My initial role within the company was as an Application Developer. I was responsible for customizing Instec's Policy product for over 20 of Instec's clients. Instec's Policy product is an application that generates insurance policies. At its core, Policy is a robust rating engine that generates a premium based on the type of business being insured and desired coverages.</p>
                        <p>A majority of development was done using an in-house 4GL programming language akin to C. This custom language was built upon a revisioning framework which allowed us to customize the product for our clients. These customizations needed to account for bureau regulations required for all states in the country dependent on the effective date of every policy created. There was also a scripting language similar to COBOL that we used to generate custom insurance forms populated by the data submitted or generated in the Policy application.</p>
                        <p>Since a majority of our tools were created internally, I couldn't rely on the internet to solve my problems when I encountered them. This helped my troubleshooting abilities grow tremendously. The language limitations made the environment collaborative and I worked closely with developers as well as business analysts to meet tight deadlines. As my understanding of these tools grew, I was able to help newer developers solve their problems and better communicate technical limitations to the business people on the team. Before I changed teams, I was also given the opportunity to research and demonstrate a new form generation tool to over 40 of the developers on the Policy team. The Application Developer position was fulfilling and I learned a lot about development because of its unique setting. My understanding of our software translated very well to helping the Underwriting team with the company's newest product.</p>

                        <h5>Underwriting Product - QA Content Engineer - 2019 - Present</h5>
                        
                        <p>At the end of 2018, Instec's Underwriting product needed development help and I was selected to temporarily join the Underwriting team. I played a crucial role in the development of the product which led to a promotion and I was officially brought on to the Underwriting team in 2019.</p>
                        <p>Underwriting is Instec's newest product and it's a web application in the cloud built upon .NET core using C#, Azure Cosmos DB, and Typescript. At Underwriting's core, it is a workflow tool that is used to automate the more mundane processes of an underwriter's work. It's kind of like Jira, but used by underwriters instead of development teams. My original responsibility for the Underwriting product was to configure insurance programs.  An insurance program is a market that represents a group with similar types of risk. When I joined the team, Underwriting's configuration design tools either didn't exist or were very primitive, which is why the team needed a programmer. These days, most configuration is done by a business analyst and I only get involved if things aren't working correctly or if they need guidance.</p>
                        <p>In the early days, configuration was done using Underwriting's SDK. I created a tool with C# that could read a formatted spreadsheet and configure a tenant based on the details of the spreadsheet. This tool gave the Underwriting team the ability to quickly setup a client area and to demonstrate the software to potential clients. The tool also became an integral part of the end-to-end automated test process. A spreadsheet fed into this tool contained all of the components of an insurance program in an easy-to-read view. We no longer use a spreadsheet, instead we can export insurance programs by serializing all the models of a program and storing them in a zip file. I wrote a lot of the code for zipping programs as well. That is a simplified explanation of how I got the sole title of "QA Content Engineer". In the team we refer to "Content" as the insurance programs I configure, but I also develop tests and the tools to drive them hence "QA Engineer".</p>
                        <p>Underwriting's automated tests are written in C#, Gherkin, and Typescript. We use the following frameworks to drive our tests: Specflow, the Telerik Testing Framework, and Karma. When I started on Underwriting, I was primarily focused on QA, be it testing or developing tools that helped testing efforts. Since the end of 2020, we dissolved the QA team and now treat the QA engineers as regular engineers. Every engineer is now responsible for developing features as well as automated tests. I'm a QA specialist to reference in case anyone has any trouble developing tests.</p>
                        <p>The Underwriting product is currently in beta and we support a single client with more clients coming onboard soon. As of April 2021, Instec was acquired by Insurity and Underwriting was certainly a factor in the purchase of the company. I'm very grateful to be part of the Underwriting team and also extremely proud of everything our small team, of 12, has accomplished. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited for whatever opportunities arise next!</p>

                    <h4>Illinois Department of Transportation</h4>
                    <h5>Software Development Co-op - 2016 - 2017</h5>

                    <p>I started working at the Illinois Department of Transportation as a Software Development Co-op in the summer before my senior year of NIU. It was an internship that I worked full time during school breaks and part time during the regular school year. My focus was developing software within the IT department.</p>
                    <p>A majority of my time at IDOT was spent creating a contractor submittal system using C#, a SharePoint client, and the .NET framework. The program was used by internal and external users to coordinate contract work for the department. This contract work used to be submitted through the post office and could take up to six weeks for the correspondence between the two types of users. This submittal system was instant and saved the department a ton of time coordinating contractual efforts. I didn't create this program by myself, but I had a lot of influence on the creation and design of the program. A senior programmer for the department mentored me during the development of the program and would assist me when I got stuck, but for the most part I worked on the program alone.</p>
                    <p>The other major project that I worked on during my time there was a personnel tracking system written in VB.net and a WCF data service. The system was used by various managers throughout the department to track important data for their personnel. Things like current title, responsibilities, emergency contact information, and other bits of data were collected.</p>
                    <p>During my time at IDOT I also developed small tools and provided help desk support to the 500+ people that worked at the Schaumburg location. It was a great experience that gave me a professional foundation for all of my development skills I carry today. The most important skill I obtained was the ability to handle multiple problems at once. The spring of my senior year I had to balance work, school, applications, interviews, etc. IDOT gave me all the resources they could and they helped me balance everything. I'm especially grateful for my time working there since they started my career in software development.</p>

                    <h4>Northern Illinois University</h4>
                    <h5>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - 2014 - 2017</h5>

                    <p>I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from Northern Illinois University. I graduated with honors, studying Computer Science with an Emphasis on Enterprise Software and a minor in Business Administration. A majority of my studies were taught using C++. These studies included an introductory course, an intermediate course, data structures, computer architecture, databases, and operating systems. The main curriculum's development environment was done on a Unix server using makefiles and the command line.</p>
                    <p>We also had unique development environments for a few other courses. NIU has a big emphasis on low level programming and one of my favorite courses was learning Assembler on an IBM mainframe computer. I didn't understand how a computer worked until I took this course and it provided a lot of clarification on how programs are interpreted by computers. I also took a follow up course that focused on enterprise software and continued to use Assembler as well as COBOL. These experiences have helped me debug register and memory problems that I would have struggled to resolve on my own otherwise.</p>
                    <p>My other favorite class was the Introduction to Software Engineering course. This course was vital to my time at NIU because it was the first class where I was able to put everything I learned together and make something truly cool. We had a final project where we had to make a fake store's website and even though it was very challenging, it was rewarding to develop something that reflected a real piece of software. My final project was built using HTML, PHP, and MySQL. My portfolio website was designed using a lot of the same technologies and skills I learned in that course.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the computer science courses, I took various math related courses such as discreet math, calculus 1, and calculus 2. The business courses I enrolled in included accounting, marketing, management, etc. I had a fantastic time studying at NIU. I made great memories with lifelong friends some of which I work with today at Instec!</p>
